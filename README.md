# React + Vite

Apply my knowledge so far

Things to add:

1. On order, you could let the user define a PIN number for the order. Then, in the page that displays the final order, the user could be allowed to actually edit the order during the first 5 minutes after submitting it, but ONLY if they input the correct PIN number (otherwise, users could edit orders from other people). This would require a PIN to be sent to the API request on order.

2. You could add the ability to add or remove ingredients for pizzas in the cart. Again, this would require a change in the API.

3. You could persist the cart data using "Redux persist" like in this tutorial: https://blog.logrocket.com/persist-state-redux-persist-redux-toolkit-react/
